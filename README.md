# How is Weibo Feeling? - _A Sentiment Analysis of Weibo Corpus_
A sentiment and textual analysis of the [Leiden Weibo Corpus Database](http://lwc.daanvanesch.nl/index.php) which consists of 5,103,566 messages posted on Sina Weibo in January 2012.

## Introduction
This project analyzes Leiden Weibo Corpus (a Chinese microblogging dataset) to reveal, how Chinese netizens feel about particular domestic and international political developments. Because it is known that Chinaâ€™s netizens are subjected to censorship of viewing or posting content considered inappropriate or anti-government, examining social media sentiment in China is particularly unique. The issues I examine further from Weibo sentiment include the London Olympics, the Diaoyu
Island dispute, and government approval, all hotly contested topics in the government and in the media. From this project, others can understand the varying regional sentiments on these instrumental domestic and international developments across the country of China. Additionally, some questions I address include: Is public sentiment generally positive or negative when referencing domestic politics vs international politics? Is sentiment regarding topics directly correlated across regions of China and/or by sex regarding popular political developments?
